#Exercise 05: Development Enviornment
Upload a screen capture of your computer with the development environment for your project running.

For example, if your project is web-based, it should have a terminal window open showing the server running as well as a browser window open showing the website running on the localhost.

In addition to windows relating to the development environment, have a text editor open with your full name typed in it.

Convert and upload the screen capture as a PDF (on Blackboard).
