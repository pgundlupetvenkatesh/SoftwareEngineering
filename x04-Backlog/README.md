#Exercise 04: Product Backlog

A product backlog is a sort of [to do list that is a important part of Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog). 

Backlogs typically have three main categories:

* To Do
* Doing
* Done

Cards are placed into one of those categories, depending on its issue's status. Often, cards are written as **User Stories**. User stories are written from the perspective of the software *user*, such as "As a *customer*, I want to *search by product number* so that *I can find a specific item I'm looking for." This follows the format:

> As a *role*, I want *goal* so that *benefit*

For this exercise, you will work within your groups to help build a list of user stories for a new product. The product will be a website that supports Free and Open Source project communication and backlogs. It will be sort of like a combination of an IRC channel or chat tool like [Slack](http://slack.com) and a backlog tool like [Trello](http://trello.com). We will call the product **TownHall**.

Create a file within this folder in the repo named *your-team-name.md* (in markdown format) that lists user stories for the product, **TownHall**. In the file, first list all team members' names and then create a bullet-point list of each user story.
